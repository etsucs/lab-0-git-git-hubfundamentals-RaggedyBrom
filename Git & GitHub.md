Git & GitHub

## What is a Version Control System (VCS)
- Used to manage files and directories
- Tracks changes over time
- Recall prevoius versions
- Source Control is a subset of VCS

## Repository (Repos)
- Used to organize a single project
- Can contain all sorts of types of data, not just code

## Branching
- Branching allows different features or ideas to be worked on at any given time without having to make changes to the core of the code
- If the idea doesn't work out, the branch can simply be deleted

## Main (formerly called "master")
- Main is the baseline branch
- When making changes, usually a new branch should be created from main
- Any code in the main branch should always be deployable

## Commits
- Commits are changes made to a branch
- You can view the history of commits to see how code has changed over time
- Have to write a message describing the purpose of the commit
- They can be rolled back if the change is erroneous or no longer need

## Pull Request
- A pull request is a discussion about commits to see if they are worthy of being added to another branch

## Merge and Deploy
- Merging is necessary to resolve changes from changes that have been made to the same part of the code
- Deployment is when your code is ready to be make it into productoin

## GitHub
- GitHub is an free, online platform to host git code repos
